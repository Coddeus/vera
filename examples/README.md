# Examples
- `dev` contains an example hot-reloaded development workflow, which reloads every time the animation ends. This is also where I try new features, so it might not do what's inside as expected
- `main` contains (hopefully) working examples, run once.
- `tests` contains other examples made to test the behaviour of the engine.
